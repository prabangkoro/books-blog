I haven't grown on a heavy reading environment. I start reading during college, yet it still a baby step. Until now, I'm still improving my reading habit and I hope in future as well.

To me reading is like breathing. In order to convert energy, you have to breath, breath is essential. Reading is essential for living. In order to increase the quality of our life, we have to learn something new. It's not a want, it's a must.

I read for pleasure. And most of the time I read books that will make my life easier.
