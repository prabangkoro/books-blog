## Review

The story develops in a good way, a lot of up and down and its kinda lovely. Tere Liye is profound in  bringing topics about family, love, enemy, etc. This book is fun to read, it is very amusing and very interesting to read.

The only major breakdown here is the resolving step, the most important thing in a story omg. It ends with so very very short explanation, also typical for Tere Liye's novel unfortunately. And also when comes the love chapter, it's too cheesy to me. Maybe it's amusing for other, but to me just nope. I've seen this formula quite often since I read a lot of his book.

But after all it's a good to go book ~
