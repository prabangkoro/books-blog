# My Workflow

Of course I have a certain workflow for my reading. In the beginning it's not very organized, but I improve and tweak my system everytime.

1. Reading the book. I usually do put some highlights and bookmarks to important informations.
2. Update anything into `Goodreads`
3. Create a complete summary on `Notion`
4. Create a simple summary on this blog.

## Why Not Notion Since the Beginning?

I have to admit that Notion do a very good job on this note taking app. But it's hard to share.

I like to write anything in Notion, I can do it unsystematically and that's perfect. I can create a draft with ease there.

In other word, Notion is personal consumption, while this blog will be public.
